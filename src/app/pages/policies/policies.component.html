    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Buyers can cancel orders after purchase but only before the item is marked
      as <strong>"Shipped"</strong> by the Runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cancellation fee of <strong>10%</strong> will be deducted from the
      refund to cover transaction and service charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds will be processed within <strong>3 working days</strong>,
      depending on the payment method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated cancellations may lead to account restrictions. Buyers are
      encouraged to confirm purchases carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      For disputes regarding cancellation fees, buyers can contact customer
      support for resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Runner cancels the order, a full refund will be provided without
      deductions.
